time.cpp
#This is a test program that grabs the current date and time and
#writes it to an external file. 

test.cpp
#This is a program that first prints a title of 'Welcome to Management'.
#Next is asks the user whether they want to enter 'hacking' mode or to 
#enter a database search. If the database search is selected, the user is 
#asked to for their name and to chose whether they want to be an assassin, a bar#barian, or a sniper. It then logs their name, choice, and date of creation
#to an external file. I know this program is all over the place, but it is just
#for fun.
